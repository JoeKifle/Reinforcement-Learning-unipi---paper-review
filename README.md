# Reinforcement-Learning-unipi-paper-review
Presentation research papers on the topic of "Transfer learning" for Reinforcement learning. I have covered the following three papers. All three papers uses different techniques to transfer knowledge from previously learned task and achieved a good result.

1. Sim-to-Real Robot Learning from Pixels with Progressive Nets. Andrei et al., 2018.<br>

2. Domain Adaptation For Reinforcement Learning On The Atari. Thomas et al., 2018.<br>

3. Transfer Learning for Reinforcement Learning on a Physical Robot. Samuel et al., 2010.<br>
